### CPSC 120

* Lab 1
Lab 1, part 1 was a favorite because it was the start of my whole coding lab. 
That was when I learned many things like using github and how to push and commit
my work back to github. Even though it was a simple code it was where I started 
so I would call it my favorite.


* Lab 3

Lab 3, was a favorite because it seemed like something that I would use. I learned 
how to use formulas for the code. Also, it seemed like it would be something that I 
would use for myself and I would show my friends and have them use it to show them o
f the work I have done that can be used to help them find information about themselves.


* Lab 9

Lab 9, was a favorite because I would say it was one of my first ever games I coded. 
During this coding lesson I learned how to improve the if statement. Even though the 
game was a simple game it was a little complex because the output for the answer could 
be different based on the answer you gave the code.
